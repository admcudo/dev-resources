# Create a New Cudos Address with Keplr Wallet
This is for creating an new Keplr wallet using the extension in Chromium-based browsers

1. Head to this link which will take you to the Keplr extension on the Chrome Web Store:
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap

2. Add the extension to your browser. Always make sure the extension is the real one.

3. You can sign in with Google however this is less secure, we suggest clicking the "Create new account" button. (Or better, using a Ledger hardware device for added security)

4. Write down your 12 or 24 word mnemonic seed phrase (24-word for added security). Never give this phrase to anyone, this is what controls access to all your digital assets on the blockchain!

5. Give your account a name and click "Next". Select the mnemonic words in the order you wrote them down and click "Register"

6. Head to the Cudos Dashboard to add the Cudos chain to the Keplr dropdown menu. For mainnet, go [here](https://dashboard.cudos.org/), and for testnet, go [here](http://dashboard.testnet.cudos.org/). Note, the same wallet controls your interactions on both the testnet and mainnet.

7. Click the "Connect Keplr wallet" button.

8. Accept the two Keplr popups for the Chain Add Request, and Requesting Connection

- Your Keplr should now have the CudosNetwork added and available from the drop-down box at the top of the extension! Your Cudos Address is the field beginning with cudos1 !

> :warning: *Remember, your tokens aren't stored in your wallet, they are stored on the blockchain! So always keep your mnemonic phrase safe, nobody will ever need it to support you!
